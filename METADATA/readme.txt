Readme METADATA CD

Here we find:

All the following have been developed on CD_MP files from LEGISLATURA / TERM X

--Diputados: CD MP files from legislatura/term X

-- CD_MPs.dtd: USE DTD TO VALIDATE MP_DATABASE
-- mp_cd_regex: you apply script directly to the MPs files and it gives them basic tags. 
-- mp_cd_reordering: You apply this script after you have applied the previous one. It results in the final product. But there may be some editing.
-- total_Dips_CD_to_validate.xml: This document includes some unnecesary tags for the final product (such as XML identifier, mps or speaker) which are required to validate the document and be sure it is alright.
--total Dips_CD.xml: Final product. This is the document that will be used to export data onto the speeches. Remember we have added the additional_info tags and subtags (are we including them in speeches?)
